      <p><strong>WAIT, it's been a MONTH?!;</strong><br />
      <em>November 2nd, 2012</em>      </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HA! Look, it's a teaser trailer! My life isn't worthless after all.<br />
          <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, my life isn't worthless, that's a bit of self-deprecating humor. I'm entitled to that.<br />
          <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously, a note about self-deprecating humor - it's the most selfless form of humor there is. No one gets their feelings hurt.<br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well okay, I guess there are puns, too. Puns and self-deprecating humor, that's where it's at.<br />
          <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can tell I'm tired because I'm thinking in short paragraphs. 'Ol Sandy really took the best out of all of us.<br />
          <br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of Tesla, Marco Tempest recently <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-WkUKP1l3c">did a nice little omage</a> to him recently. I'd like to call it more an educational tidbit than a masterclass of storytelling, but it's great to see people continue to support his legacy. Slowly but surely, I think.<br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's one bit there that I pick a bone with - Tesla didn't really lose funding for his wireless tower because he said it could 'contact martians', people actually thought it was cool and that it was a nice side effect, it was the fact that it could generate and transmit power wireless FOR FREE and that wasn't a profitable model. Marco doesn't even mention that this was the main point of Wardenclyffe. It kind of... diminishes how awesome Tesla's vision was.<br />
          <br />
          Oh, Tesla, if you could only see the sad state the world is in now.<br />
          <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry, I'm trying to bring the swag back into science. Or at least, Neil deGrasse Tyson is. <br />
          <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engineering CAN be used to make cool art-like things. Take these stage designs, for instance. CAD, engineering, material design. That totally went it to all that. <br />
          <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've recently revised my 'concentration' or, in more general terms, my course of study, from 'Multimedia and Engineering' to just plain ol' 'Narrative Engineering'. <br />
          <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I realized this whilist I was trying to mathematically plot curves for dramatic tension in a narrative over time with pieces of sine waves. <br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I realized that what I was working on, in conjunction with some other ideas I'd been tossing around, were all forms of this... narrative engineering.<br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've never really liked the name 'multimedia and engineering' for my concentration, it seemed good enough... but this really feels right.<br />
          <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not to brag, but it's my combined knowledge of psychology, computer science and narrative understanding that makes me want to fix <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpxzgeues94">this</a> so badly.<br />
          <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The description of 'narrative engineering' doesn't preclude me from heading off creative works, either. After all, I'm an engineer! I build things - art with the function to tell stories!<br />
          <br />
      It really feels great to have that one last thing click, you know? </p></td>
