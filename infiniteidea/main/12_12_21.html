    <strong>NYU ITP Showcase;</strong><br />
    <em>December, 21st, 2012</em><br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just wanted to get a last post out of the way before I head off for the holidays (and we begin the new year!). I'm bushed so I'll make it quick;<br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SO SPEAKING OF MYSITENAMEHERE<br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to the ITP show that they have twice a year at Tisch (I, uh, go to NYU, yeah) and hey you know I think I just might make a habit of this. Most of it wasn't SUPER impressive but it was such a nicely compacted cluster of cool and I really enjoyed running about and doling out unwarranted advice to people. Here are a few of my favorites;<br /><br />
    
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>"Drones +"<br /></strong>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/dronestream">Josh Begley</a><br /><br /> </em>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This started out as an iPhone app which basically intended to just straight-up text you whenever a US drone strike goes down. Legit. I'mma not dip into politics so les' jus' say these drone strikes are pretty heavy on my radar. <br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I joked with Josh, asking if one could, with this app, text back to the drones. And say meaningful things, like 'hey, stop'.<br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately he applied to the App Store three times. The first two times, Apple said they rejected the app due to 'technical reasons'. On the third submission they revealed that it was because the app contained 'innapropriate content'. <br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*adds to my slowly accumulating list of 'reasons why I dislike Apple'*<br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, it just exists as a twitter feed, which is kinda cool I guess, but not nearly as day-interruptingly awesome as the App would have been.<br /><br />
    
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey, maybe Google wouldn't mind injecting a daily dose of reality into everyone's lives? <br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naw, probably not. We'll probably just have to wait for <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2400487,00.asp">Linux</a> for <a href=" http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/Linux-For-Devices-Articles/Linux-Mobile-Phones/">phones</a>. <br /><br />
    
    
   
    
    <strong>"Hamlet Simulator"<br /></strong>
    <em>by <a href="http://erinfinnegan.com">Erin Finnegan</a><br /><br /></em>
    
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this simple "narrative engine" (and inside, I giggle) you imput a series of 'stats' into your own custom Hamlet character, a 1-10 scale for everything from empathy to intelligence. The game then uses its internal "narrative map" (giggle) to determine a sequence of outcomes, relative to Shakespeare's world. <br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very end it includes a 'death percentage'. I recieved a death percentage of 12. The canonical Hamlet allegedly has a death percentage of 73. I have no idea what that means. When prompted, Erin explained that the death percentage is 'whatever you want it to be'.<br /><br />
    
    <center>oooooh<br /><br /></center>
    
    <center>aaaah<br /><br /></center>
    
    <center>er<br /><br /></center>
    
    <center>okay then<br /><br /></center>
    
    <center>darn, so close<br /><br /></center>
    
    <strong>"Sonified Data" <br /></strong>
    <em>By <a href="http://hannah-davis.net">Hannah Davis</a> <br /><br /></em>
    
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, much like the "Hamlet Simulator", this is VERY very very relevant to my interests. If you... if you take a second, just a second to look over at that 'about' category and... yeah yep YES okay <br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll see that my own course of studies at NYU have sorta converged on and centered themselves around this concept I like to call "Narrative Engineering". Unfortunately I'm left to confer what EXACTLY that means on my own time, but I can tell you what is and what isn't in this strange new yonder.  What Hannah has done in "Sonified Data" is pick different literary authors and distilled their writing styles down into musical modes, linking language and music, which, hey, they were pretty much the same thing to begin with, right? (<a href="http://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/CD.music.lang.htm http://music.dartmouth.edu/~larry/music1052008/readings/Patel_2003_Nature_Neuroscience.pdf">suggested reading</a>) Syllabic structures are converted into rhythms, embellishing adverbs and adjectives into high flourishes, and the general 'sense' of each 10 sentences is converted to a mode - major or minor (kinda the part I think we BOTH wished she'd had the time to explore further). <br /><br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm very interested in using algorithms to detect motifs and themes in a piece of writing based on degrees of word association, and projects like this one are definitely the infantile stages to such a model. <br /><br />
    
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, my Narrative design model. I will be there soon, my sweet. And this lifetime, we will be lovers. </tr>
