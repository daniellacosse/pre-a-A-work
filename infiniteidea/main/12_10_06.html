        In relevant things, you should know that I managed to get a hold of a drive. My editor can finally get started, bless his heart<br />
        <br />
        I have a bunch of cool things to show you, I'll make it quick;<br /><br />
        EVERYONE hates on facebook's timeline, and stuff like this is why 
        <a href="http://www.psfk.com/2012/09/facebook-timeline-teach-history-schools.html" target="_blank">I don't think it's that bad</a>.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw this potential immediately and figured it was only a matter of time. Sure, the two column format is a bit wonky. Maybe they'll rearrange it. If not, whatever. It's a free, ad-less service (if you use AdBlock, which you should). They can do whatever they want as long as it doesn't involve putting cameras in my bathroom.<br />
      <p>Visual vegans may want to <a href="http://www.toxel.com/tech/2008/12/20/gadgets-and-designs-inspired-by-bacon/" target="_blank">avert their eyes</a>.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly like the alarm clock and the bandages. I find this hilarious. It's so disgusting and yet so delicious. I know rule 34 applies specifically to pornography, but I feel at its essence it's a acknowledgment to the seemingly limitless number of permutations of our universe (woah hey what's this site called again) - like this. Bacon-themed items. Keep it up.<br />
<p>Every medium has <a href="http://www.the-gutters.com/comic/330-jeremy-rock" target="_blank">their own set of weak cliches</a>.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though a couple of these concepts can transfer over to other mediums - particularly the 'wordiness' aspect of the first panel. While it's more acceptable in film, there is a point where you can have too much dialogue. I would say Chris Nolan tends to walk that very fine line. I can understand the appeal - it's a fun line to walk.<br /><br />
I want to see more music videos <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9a1C1qXHfM" target="_blank">like this,</a> hands down.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mini-cinematic, short film set to music. It's not musicians wandering about aimlessly with their guitars, or dancing about in whatever scraps they could find in their garbage can, but a serious marriage of typical cinema conventions with good music. Granted, this specific example of such a music video is a bit 'interpretable', meaning, it's blatantly 'about' something, which makes it a little psuedo-intellectual to me. It feels forced, in the way that it's the kind of film that anyone can stand up and easily proclaim 'I KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT' and that type of story doesn't CHALLENGE anyone. Still, it is quite good, and I suggest you look into the film's director, goes by the name of  <a href="http://www.nabil.com/" target="_blank">'Nabil'</a>  . He's a little bit too instagram-happy for my liking but, hey, he's got a good grasp of aesthetic. MY OPINIONS ARE INTERESTING AND ABSOLUTE<br />
<p>Another music video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVuUwvUUPro" target="_blank">along the same lines</a>.<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is quite nice. Yes, it is beautiful. I love the noir. But… it's missing that extra 'BAM-O', and I think that's the lack of zest in the premise. I didn't learn anything watching this. People love each other, and as a result it feels like they can stop a train and move mountains. And then they do nothing because IT CAN NEVER BE. I've seen it plenty of times before.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's not that there's nothing left to be said about love. Off the top of my head, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RUMpYDlE5Y" target="_blank">here's something</a> I recently heard that I learned from. <br />
      Of course this is all experientially based, I guess it just depends on what you've seen and what you haven't. So, if feel different, that 'Nuit Blanche' has imparted upon you some sort of grand epiphany, feel free to leave a comment belo-</p>
<p><center>oh wait</center></p>
I'll get around to that eventually. <br  />

        A Disclaimer: Everything I've posted here I like, and not for the reasons you may think. I'm a big believer in what I like to call &quot;non-polarized opinions&quot; meaning that, instead of a single continuum of evaluation from 'good' to 'bad' (a la RottenTomatoes) my opinions are of a multidimensional matrix. Everything comes from a standpoint of 'learning', ergo usually if I learn something from a work of art then I will tend to like it more. But it depends. Maybe I should whip up a diagram.<br />
