  <br /><strong><font class="Title">The Vietnam Documentary, 'A Bolt, A Bird,' and a War;</font></strong><br />
  <em>MARCH 1st, 2012</em><br />
  <br />
  <font class="Article">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Version 2.1 is roaring and ready to go! Not really much more than a few vital rearrangements. Things are start going to get interesting come the next version and henceforth. Note; I'm aware the two-column text wrap doesn't work in IE... I'll get around to it.<br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly the 'Untitled Vietnam Documentary' is going... slowly. I still don't even have a name for it yet. I've been working at it a little bit each day, picking out what I like to call 'highlights' (I'm ignorant to what actual documentary-makers call them, but essentially I'm just dragging well-shot and informational clips from the raw footage into the time-line). Another thing that consumes a lot of time - stabilization analysis. Yes, iMovie supports stabilization, for some reason. Unfortunately it's not incredibly sophisticated (nothing like my copy of AE5.5 back home) but it usually does more harm than good. (Usually). Thankfully I can at least work on the site while all that processin' is goin' down. No promises, but hopefully before I leave for spring break I'll have fashioned together some sort of preview.<br />
    
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENOUGH STALLING. What is this mysterious 'A Bolt, A Bird' I speak of? Well my friends, this summer I am slated to shoot a short film about the latter days of the incredible inventor Nikola Tesla. During the last few years of his life, the Serbian genius was certainly put through the ringer. Most interestingly, he claims to have fallen in love with a pidgeon, who paid him visits religiously until the day that pidgeon died. That will be the focus of the film, sans a major detail or two - I'm going to leave it at that for now. As of this moment I've got a full, semi-immature draft of the script and am working on aquireing locations with my lovely producer. It is very likely that the film could be shot in the very room where Tesla died. I KNOW, I can't believe it either. My life has devolved into a perpetual panic attack/nerdgasm.<br />
    
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, I said something about a 'war'? Okay, okay. Agree with me or not, but there's this online class all NYU Florence students are required to take called 'Topics in Italian Culture' which... I feel based on the way it's structured just encourages subconscious discrimination. For my first blog post I was required to see one Italian film and then from that pull themes or motifs common in Italian art, and most importantly, focus on how Italian art is different from art in my home country. That's not a question I can answer having seen one film. So I wrote a 500-word blog post about how I couldn't answer that question and why, and tangentially my theories on subconscious discrimination (unfortunately I just thought of this term, I probsies shoulda used it). I received a failing grade for lack of "throughfulness (sic), creativity, or writing skills." Yeah. They gave me a chance to rewrite the entry. So in response I wrote another, slightly less-antagonistic, 500-word version, stating that "I will not be strong-armed by poor grades..." and that "...debate is the only way to truly converge upon the appropriate solution, not a docile acceptance of the status quo." They're going to have to fight me. The first and second essays can be found <a href="archive/topicsinitalianwar.txt">here</a>. I'm usually not this confrontational, I promise. Feel free to debate with meif you're bored enough.<br />
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's recently come to my attention that the teacher doesn't really want to be doing this, that she thinks the class is stupid too... We'll see how it goes down. To quote Bill Watterson: "FURTHER UPDATES AS EVENTS WARRANT". Actually I'm pretty sure that was a quote of Bill Watterson quoting something else. Whatever, it's the context that matters. <br />
