    <p><strong>WAIT, it's been ANOTHER MONTH?!;</strong><br />
      <em>December 1st, 2012</em>      </p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm cleary behind on my postings, (I blame Sandy) so here's a buncha cool things I've come across lately. It feels like I've got an insurmountable amount of work at the moment, so that's my excuse for any current lack of updates slash any lack of updates in the near future.
If only I had a team of slaves to- POLITICALLY INCORRECT FILTER BLOCKER 2000 ACTIVATED
 <br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of filters, doubtless you've heard of the '<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html">filter bubble</a>' - it's one of those things that mean well but is actually harmful because it just <a href="http://www.sodahead.com/united-states/is-the-united-states-more-divided-than-ever/question-3339157/">divides us as a country</a> because it encourages dangerous things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_polarization">group polarization</a>. Sure, as my anonymous friend says, “…thank goodness for the filter bubble. Honestly. I'm glad there are mechanisms in place that allow me to screen out irrelevant nonsense.” It sounds like a great idea, and with a bit more sophistication I don’t think there would be any qualms – for instance, say, instead of having your particular filter bubble determine 100% of your search results, perhaps there’s a ‘devil’s advocate’ clause, a filter that is antonymous to your demographic (so for example, in my case, a devil’s advocate filter would target statist financiers or something) that contributes to your search results in a certain way. OR EVEN; whenever you search something, you get a main set of results that are generated by your specifications, and then, on the side, like in a separate column or something, there’s a header that says “What other people are searching for;” that is populated by your antonymous filter.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do you burst your filter bubble? One thing I try to do is frequent different news sources like <a href="www.brainpickings.com">this</a> and <a href="bbc.com">that</a> and <a href="http://www.etcetera.com/news/">etcetera</a>, but the seemingly BEST thing to do, really, is seek out reasonable people who have contrasting viewpoints and FORCE MYSELF to discern the logical foundations from where they’re coming. For example, I just had a long discussion about Obamacare. The person in question with whom I discussed listed story after story about how its policies are crippling small businesses, and how the only reason why the unemployment rate is so low is because people are just giving up on finding work (and allegedly you’re not counted after a certain period of time, there’s a series of distinctions that determine whether you’re actually unemployed or just ‘<a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm#unemployed">not in the labor force</a>’). I don’t know if the number of people ‘not in the labor force’ is greater or fewer than before, but I do know that Obamacare is great for a lot of people who can’t get insurance for their potentially lethal pre-existing conditions. We agreed that there are possibly pros and cons with the system, based on what we discussed. These stories would have never reached my ears if it wasn’t for him. I have a feeling that for most reasonable people, their opinions are formed by what they read. I can’t have opinions about what I don’t read, a fact that very well may be at the heart of why our country is so polarized right now.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know really, I’m just pontificating. Conformation bias and belief perseverance are my enemies, and I wish more people felt that way, or even knew what those things were.
Okay, whew, that got a bit too political for my liking. Necessarily so, but goodness I’m adverse to people’s eagerness to chastise others’ based on their political beliefs, especially when it really just comes down to what they have and haven’t heard. Here’s hoping we’re not in the middle of some cyber civil war in a few years’ time.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Ideas. As we become more and more ingrained in internet (and computer) culture, I feel that more people REALLY need to understand how computers and software works (including being cognizant of things like the filter bubble). If *I* was in charge of the public school system, I would make kids take at least one software and one hardware class. In the hardware class, we’d first go over the basic computer parts (mouse, keyboard, etc) and then move on to the more intricate parts of the computer 
(RAM, CPU, etc) and eventually the class would culminate in the assembly of some dummy desktop computers. The software class would come next, in which students would learn the fundamentals of some language (BASIC or Phython or something) using a VISUAL coding system, something to the effect of <a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">this</a>. Of course we all know how impossible it is to change anything in any public school system… so this is really nothing more than an elaborate daydream, as I’m not about to devote my life to this, but it would certainly curb the ‘technology is mysterious’ effect that Apple really likes to play up. To become more and more subsistent on something we don’t understand, and even romanticize our ignorance of? That’s messed up, yo.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh, in closing, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddw1_3ZVjTE">this, too</a>. Some poetry and thoughts and animations to mentally chew on. I particularly identify with the whole ‘forgetting’ one, sometimes it feels like a lot of my life is devoted to taking precautions against me forgetting everything. A recursive task – should I forget to take those precautions, well, all is lost.<br /><br />
