      <p><strong>Site Build v2.2;<br />
      </strong><em>September 17th, 2012 </em></p>
      <p>Wow, it was a bit easier than I anticipated to implement the &lt;iframe&gt; feature, however, there are still a couple bugs;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The scrollbars appear to only function as intended in Chrome, as far as I'm aware.</li>
        <li>If you have your browser set up such that links open in a new tab, the &lt;iframe&gt; won't function properly.</li>
        <li>A few of the 'Miscellaneous Links' don't open in the iframe for some reason. I'm guessing those sites are designed not to do so.</li>
        <li>A couple other minor design refinements need to be made.</li>
        
      </ul>
      <p>Yes, yes I know that learning something like PHP or JavaScript would fix these issues, but for now it will have to do. I think these simple changes improve the site's accessibility immensely. Click around and check it out, just remember to click on the left bar to come back here.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/ABoltABird">A Bolt, A Bird</a> is now in post-production and coming along nicely. We've begun editing it and are planning a second <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/aboltabirdmovie">Indiegogo</a> run. We've got a lot of post to do considering  that Anna (Tesla's love interest) will <strong>now be</strong> <strong>animated</strong>, and that doesn't come cheap. To put a long story short, the puppet didn't work out. I'm hoping the fact that we actually have footage will  help us out this time around. We also still owe money to a few good samaritans. <a href="tribute.html">Here's</a> everyone who helped with the first run of contributions.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently attended a performance by the group <a href="http://devotchka.net/">DeVotchKa</a>, and man, are they awesome. I was lucky enough to use my recently-acquired first cute little smart phone and take some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvvg3H9b7KU&amp;feature=autoshare">footage</a>. Funny story, I uploaded it to my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/futureruler1?ob=0&amp;feature=results_main">YouTube account</a> (because it was just some video I took with my cell phone) and YouTube was all</p>
     <ul>
       <p>"Hey, this is shaky. You want us to fix that?"<br />
         Me: &quot;OK YouTube show me what you got&quot;
 </p>
     </ul>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first I wasn't quite sure if I liked the result - but it definitely grew on me. I  could have achieved more <strong>accurate</strong> results using After Effects, but the effect generated by YouTube's algorithm is pretty neat. What an amazing age. Consider it my own little <a href="http://davidoreilly.com/">David O'Reilly</a> moment. I want to have that man's small children.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently read The Garden of Forking Paths and was consumed by the spirit to share my impressions with everyone. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCgQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmanovich.net%2Fvis242_winter_2006%2FNew%2520Media%2520Reader%2520all%2F01-borges-03.pdf&ei=jB9SUMXFA8fh0QGgq4HADg&usg=AFQjCNGJHEU0A7szXtgWK1BlKkyUOt9rwA&sig2=KcgbqjmL3wNzPGBWcTQNnQ">Here</a> is the original article if you're so inclined. <br />
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was written by Jorge Louis Borges in 1941, spawning the concept of what came to be known as the 'hypertext novel' - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_%28Julio_Cort%C3%A1zar_novel%29"> first of which </a> written by Julio Cortazar in 1963, a concept which evolved into what us 90s kids today call the <a href="http://www.cyoa.com/">'Choose Your Own Adventure'</a> Novel. It exercises control over what some call <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqeqW3g8N2Q">'the 5th dimension'</a>, a dimension, like space or time, across all possible outcomes -  there is some dispute amongst the scientific community over the plausibility of such a concept (plausibility that walks hand-in-hand with the ultimate fate of <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~banchoff/STG/ma8/papers/dstanke/Project/Superstrings.html">string theory</a>) - I, personally, just like to think of it as an 'interactive book', though that may oversimplify the concept.<br />
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The story in the article is simple enough, a German spy during the first World War is on the run and reaches out to a man named Dr. Albert for aid. Dr. Albert confuses the spy for another man and shows him his garden. By happenstance, we learn that it is the garden of the spy's ancestors. A whole history is unearthed, and the story of Ts'ui Pen is told.<br />
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ts'ui Pen, in the story, was famed for having written an indecipherable novel, and devoting the extent of his days to its realization. He commonly would withdraw to work on 'a labyrinth and a novel'. An epiphany - the labyrinth was not the garden where the spy grew up, but the novel itself!<br />
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personallyâ€¦ I think that Ts'ui Pen is given too much credit (in the context of the story). You can't invent a new medium if it's an ergonomical disaster. This is how I would approach any kind of concept that I know others had not encountered before - you've got to spell it out. The 'Choose Your Own Adventure' novels are case in point. Your decisions are clear and their consequences made apparent. If the series of possible events are strung in a linear order, and readers are operating under the modus of their inherent knowledge to how the media functions, they're just going to read the book in a linear fashion and wind up utterly confused. The keystone of the design is to consider the audience, and Ts'ui Pen did not do that.<br />
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Granted, it sounded as if he was a bit crazy. Speaking in riddles when he could've just straight out said what he was working on. <br />
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ultimately, though, it is a great concept. Good on you, Jorge.  Way to mix it up. Party like it's 1941.<br />
