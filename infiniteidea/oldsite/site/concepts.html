His fractured reality spins around him without warning, hopefully strip the viewer of, by the end of the work, any kind of sense of realism. It is a exploration of the human psyche, questions if reality truly is more defined than fantasy, and even transcends onto a plane of universal subconcious, the plane that Mr. Carl oversees in My Last Heaven. It is a story of misguided love, that the main character's determined chase of his soulmate into the afterlife is actually a frenzied search for self-meaning within his final moments. </font></p>

It begins with the hero, a teenager named Louis, finding himself trapped within a coma. In his prison he is confronted by the mysterious Mr. Carl, purveyor of the Collective Unconcious. Mr. Carl's job, in the grander scheme of things, is to, from time to time, select individuals  to remotely run tests on,  helping to asses the current strength of humanity and the Collective Unconcious. Louis later finds he is chosen by Mr. Carl because Mr. Carl feels Louis is inable to pass the test, treating Louis like any of his more mature experimentees. Why Mr. Carl seems to be sabotaging the fate of the Collective Unconcious is unkown to Louis, and in order for him to find out, he must first survive the horrors of his own psyche.</font></td>
