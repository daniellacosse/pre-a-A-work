  <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><p>Mrs. Rye found herself crutched upon glass, tears, and  serility. Not the most ideal things you'd want to have consoling you at a time  like this, but the odorless floursecent hallway was all the world that Mrs. Rye  had at the moment. She'd have to make due.<br />
    Just a few feet behind Mrs. Rye a couple men murmured in  low, respectful tones, tones reserved for lost souls and empty rooms. It was  the former, and aruguably the latter, which had brought these characters to  this unfortunate spectacle, a spectacle which was more common than most would  like to admit. <br />
    But for Mrs. Rye it wasn't a common spectacle. It was her  whole life behind a bullet-proof window. Already they had black-bagged her  eldest to make room for someone else's son. Apparently getting T-boned on a  busy intersection was a popular way to die this evening.<br />
    Her other son, Louis, was still unconcious, possibly  comatose. He was being driven back from his first date by his elder brother  when a driver with their lights off smashed into the driver's side of their  SUV. Louis' brother died fifteen minutes ago.<br />
    A doctor snuck up behind Mrs. Rye and touched her softly on  the shoulder, telling her that it was likely Louis would never wake up. So he  did what doctors seems to always do.<br />
  &quot;If we remove the breathing apparatus, then he would be  able to rest in peace. I know he's only 14 ma'am, but...&quot; He looked back  at one of his colleagues. &quot;sometimes these things happen.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Yes, but...&quot; Mrs. Rye's head seemed to be pulled  in two different directions, two different emotions on the end of either  string. &quot;when has it ever happened to me?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Well, I'd like to tell you that you're special, but  we've got a dozen other families down here tonight, and some of them having  been dreading this for a long time. Just be thankful that...&quot;<br />
  &quot;THANKFUL? Thankful that my now only son will probably  spend the next few years as useful as my nightstand?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Not if we take... useful?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Uh, nevermind. I'm sorry, it's just that-&quot;<br />
  &quot;I understand. I'll let you be. If you change your  mind, just talk to-&quot;<br />
  &quot;I won't change my mind, thank you.&quot;<br />
  It is this world of brutal fate and misery which we leave,  for unknown to his grieving mother, Louis Rye had been chosen by a higher power  to represent humanity in a game of survival and self-discovery. A game in his  own mind.</p></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><strong>Chapter I</strong></font></p>
  <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><p>Louis' head was stuck, but his eyes didn't register it that  way. He could feel the suction on the sides of his face and he his body behind  him, but when he looked down his chest and legs looked to be just where they  should. <br />
    Ahead of him was a dimly lit hospital bed. He'd seen that  before, and suddenly felt a roaring compulsion to get away from it. Violently  he pulled away from the image, which retracted from him, just as one might  expect it to. He felt the tension on his face tighten; he knew he was trapped  somehow. He grabbed onto something on both sides of him and pushed off. The  proxy arms in his vision reached out and grabbed nothing accordingly. Suddenly  there was a loud 'pop' that left his ears ringing; his perspective changed  violently. <br />
    Louis found himself looking over a seemingly endless field  of fleshy-red hexagons; but right away he could see that each hexagon was  different. In his brief experience he was able to make out that, within the  center of each, was a distinctly different vision. Beneath him was the vision  of the hospital from which he just came, but in the hexagon adjacent to it was  a schoolyard, next to that a seaside cliff with seagulls sailing through wind  and sun- <br />
  &quot;Such a small thing...&quot;<br />
    It was a voice which removed from Louis any ability for him to  focus. His vision went blurry and the distant beeping and droning he had heard  before turned to mush; it became a sort of gooey whistle, one which resembled  both wind whistling through trees and peanut butter.<br />
    A grey figure slid  into his field of view, perhaps several feet from him, but in his daze, Louis  could only see outlines of shapes, swirling and pulsing...<br />
    “Wake up, little<em>junge</em>.”<br />
    Everything snapped back to normal. In front of Louis was a  seemingly harmless middle-aged, balding man with a grey mustache, dressed in  the proper fashion. The man’s ovular glasses were slightly tinted and reflected  the gruesome vision of the thousand hexagons just below them. He wore a grey  coat and vest, and a black tie. The only peculiar thing about his attire was  his grey trench coat; as it approached the ground, black outlines of the  hexagonal pattern became more and more discernable. <br />
    The man took out a hexagonal pocket watch and said; “You’re  just on time, son. Welcome to my realm.”<br />
    Louis was bewildered. “Who are you?”<br />
    “The name’s Carl Jung, but you’re going to call me Mr. Carl. <em>Aufstehen!</em>“  Mr. Carl, then, without warning, suddenly grabbed Louis‘ arm and yanked him to  his feet. “We have work  to do, <em>mein kind</em>. “ Suddenly they were  walking at an uncomfortably fast pace. Louis, now under Mr. Carl’s arm, was  struck by the fact that he seemed to have no scent. <br />
    “Wait, why do we have work to do? I don’t  understand. Where am I?”<br />
    “Such a response I expect from someone in your situation. We  are almost there... <em>geduld! </em>“<br />
    They  approached a black mass, which Louis found oddly familiar; it was terrifying,  no doubt, but Louis couldn’t help feeling drawn twoard it. It seemed to whisper  in a thousand voices.<br />
    They  stopped. Mr. Carl started speaking in nonsense, conversing with the mass  which seemed to be both hovering and submerged within the ground simultaneously;  Louis was pretty sure Mr. Carl was speaking in German. He looked up to ask Mr. Carl what he was saying  but was quickly shushed. <br />
    After a few  moments of this, Mr. Carl tipped his hat and turned around, dragging Louis  along with him.<br />
    “You’ve been  approved. <em>Danke</em><em>Gott...</em>” <br />
    “For what?”<br />
    “You’ll find out in a moment...” <br />
    They had quickly returned to the spot where they had begun  their short journey, arriving back at the hexagon that Louis plucked himself  out of. From a quick glance, though, Louis could tell the image in his portal  had changed. It was a forest now. <br />
    “Alright; In ya go.” <br />
    “Wait, what?”<br />
    The hexagon swelled to a larger size, a balloon filling up  with water. All of a sudden it was a pit, enticing Louis with its verdant green  forest sparking at the bottom. <br />

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><strong>Chapter II</strong></font></p>
  <font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><p>Louis knew he’d blacked out. Some time must have gone by;  he’d felt himself waking up just a moment ago. Sitting a pile of leaves, Louis  was once again dumbfounded by this sense of familiarity he felt with his  surroundings. He knew he’d never been to this place before, or even seen it,  but somehow he knew that there was a clearing down the path to the left, a  cliff behind him, among a million other details which only a skilled ranger  would know. As he went over his mental map of the forest which surrounded him,  he slowly began to sense the fact that he was not alone. He knew whatever  presence this companion had was not a friendly one. <br />
    Nearby was a sturdy twig. No other means of defense in  sight, Louis picked up the stick and held it evenly in front of him. The rustle  of leaves in the soothing wind carried a scent of amber honey – but Louis  wouldn’t let himself be soothed by it. It was the rustling which disturbed him  the most. It didn’t sound like leaves... but it’s true source remained a  mystery as Louis cautiously headed down the path.<br />
    He knew he could find some sort of help if he continued  along this route; the trail was obviously man-made, it was only a matter of  time before he finally reached an outpost or home or some sort of more direct  sign of human life. He knew where it was going, but not precisely where it  went, that is, where exactly he was headed in the general sense. It was like  he’d walked the path a few times before, but did not recall the beginning or  end of the journey; only the middle – the act of travel itself. <br />
    For a moment, the rustling became eerily quiet. It was then  Louis noticed there was no kind of wildlife in the forest – no birds, no  insects. Then he began to realize how out of place the temperature was; it was neither  too hot nor too cold, almost as if there was no temperature. He could feel no  moisture in the air. He looked up and saw light but no sun.  <br />
    As he searched for the fiery orb, the presence he had  dreaded so much drifted into view. A score of living paper dolls appeared from  behind the foliage, each roughly the size of Louis himself. Louis, finally  assuming the sun to be lost behind some cloud, returned his eyes to ground  level. A sense of fear and resolve mixed within him, a concoction he’d  unknowingly prepared for this moment.<br />
    His instinct kicked in, but not without a sense of  politeness. “Where am I? Who are you ...if you could please tell me?” He asked.  No reply. The paper dolls floated smoothly and slowly toward him on pillows of  silken air, unresponsive to his questions which lashed out like desperate  claws. “Who’s Mr. Carl? Is this real?” He pleaded, all the while holding his  branch out defensively.<br />
    One of the dolls broke the advance and rushed straight for  Louis. He reacted well, sidestepping the attack while striking the doll in the  back of the head. There was a sickening tear as the doll’s head was easily  removed from its shoulders. <br />
    Louis looked up, breathless. The other dolls seemed  unphased. Two more charged, then another two. Soon Louis found himself knee-deep  in paper, his stick wrapped with parchment. <br />
    “Having a good time?” That voice called from across the  clearing. Mr. Carl’s voice.<br />
    Louis screamed so that he might be heard amidst the  cacophony of tearing and crumpling. “Why did you send me here? What the hell is  going on?”<br />
    “Such language.” He muttered something in German.<br />
    “I DON’T UNDERSTAND YOU.”<br />
    “Perhaps it is best that way, little <em>junge</em>. I’d prefer not to tell you where you are or why you’re here,  it’s part of the examination. ” <br />
    “Then why are you here?! Stop taunting me! What are these  things?”<br />
    “I’m here because I’m required to tell you two things. Firstly,  you have powers here far greater then you realize. You simply have to accept  this.”<br />
    Louis’ weapon suddenly burst into flame, the paper wrapped  tightly around it loosening its grasp in a spiral of ash and ember. Louis  brought the stick back into his view and stood amazed by its replenishment.<br />
    “See? I will say no more on the matter. Oh! The other thing;  you are not alone here. Figures from your past will have a tendency to pop up  and follow you; however, their existence in this place may go against whatever  basic logic you might have... I believe that is all. If it is not, then that is  unfortunate- I’m afraid I must go. Take care, little <em>junge</em>.” <br />
  “WAIT!” Louis cried; but he was gone. The paper cutouts were  relentless, Louis had to find shelter. He broke through the line of enemies and  made his way down the trail to a small, mossy cavern. As he entered, a warm  light swelled all around him... it brought back memories.</p></font>
