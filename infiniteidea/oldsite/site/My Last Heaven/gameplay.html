<p><font face="Dotum, DotumChe" color="#FFFFFF">
<strong>MY LAST HEAVEN</strong> is an action RPG which consistently tests the user's ability to react to stimuli in combat through the use of the AP (Action-Potential) Interface. Not only does this prevent the gamer from having to memorize complex controls, but it allows the developer to keep the experience fresh and exciting. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">This constant stream of commands are conveyed to the user in the form of <strong>impulses</strong>, which can either be <strong>voluntary</strong> or <strong>involuntary</strong>. Involuntary impulses occur in combat, generally in response to an enemies attack. Voluntary impulses can be triggered by the player while Louis is running about, allowing them to have a level of control over the battle flow.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">These Impulses are managed through the previously mentioned <strong>API</strong>, stripped down to its basic elements;</font></p>
<p><center><img src="../../pictures/actionbar.jpg" width="75%" height="45%" alt="API" longdesc="../../pictures/actionbar.jpg" /></center></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">As you can imagine, the impulses are released from the <strong>emitter</strong> on the right end of the API and race down the<strong> axon </strong>in order to give the player a moment to register the command list. Once the impulse enters the <strong>neural well</strong>, it is subject to the player's response. The closer the player's response is to the <strong>dendrite </strong>in the center of the well determines the <strong>DP (dendrite proximity) rewards</strong> and <strong>penalties</strong> that are attributed with Louis' elicited response. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">A sequence of quality player responses increases the <strong>SP (Synaptic Progress) meter</strong>, the grey circle in the center of the neural well, and the <strong>damage multiplier</strong>, the number located above the cleft. It's maximum factor is 12... good luck getting there. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">When the SP meter is full, Louis can activate one of his <strong>synapses</strong>, a powerful ability which deals above-average damage. They are unlocked throughout the course the game as you customise Louis to your personal preferences. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">Dendrite proximity is determined by the labeled circles located within the neural well. If an involuntary impulse is activiated within the following circle, the DP consequences (DPCs) are as follows;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"> Now it's time to cover voluntary impulses with more detail: </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">There are two types of voluntary impulses; <strong>synapses</strong> and <strong>projections</strong>. Projections are, more or less, spells, and come in seven &quot;emotional&quot; flavors; Despair, Anger, Fear, Courage, Joy, Pride and Logic.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">When using a projection or synapse, the game's action pauses twice; once to allow you to make your selection and a second to select your targets. In between these pauses is the volunteered seqeuence of commands which allow you to use the ability. Like the involuntary DPCs, voluntary DPCs determine effectiveness of the attack, but cumutively rather than individually, and have no effect on the SP meter or the damage multiplier.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">Synapses are special abilites which require a full SP meter to trigger. What synapses are available to you is dependent upon how you've been customising Louis...</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><strong>Neurotransmitters</strong> are somewhat uncommon, but can be found everywhere. Once uncovered, they can be used to pave Louis' <strong>neural network</strong>, which is accessible in the game's menu. Louis' neural network is a multi-layered labyrinth of connected <strong>nerve clusters</strong> and <strong>cells</strong>, just waiting to be stimulated during Louis' travels. The cells give different bonuses based on the neurotransmitters which Louis uses to stimulate them;</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><strong>Endorphin</strong> or an Orange N.transmitter - Activating a neuron with a orange n.transmitter  usually grants a threshold or faith bonus.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><strong>Epinephrine</strong> or a Purple N.transmitter - Activating a neuron with a purple n.transmitter  usually grants an energy or instinct bonus.</font>.</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><strong>Acetylcholine </strong>or a Blue N.transmitter - Activating a neuron with a blue n.transmitter  usually grants a control bonus.</font>.</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><strong>GABA</strong> (<em>gamma-aminobutyric acid</em>) or a Red N.transmitter - Activating a neuron with a red  n.transmitter  usually grants an intimidation or potency bonus.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">An <strong>Amnesiaic </strong>or Clear N.transmitter - Use this on an already activated  nerve cluster to clear it.  These are very rare and potent, and can even increase creativity.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">Of course, the game will let you know beforehand specifically what effect will come from stimulating a certain nerve cell. You can either choose to stimulate cells individually (each cell requires 1 neruotransmitter to be stimulated) or in clusters (each cluster requires 1 neruotransmitter for each cell in it to be stimulated) which take longer to save up for and reduce customization, but grant extra bonuses in bulk and twoard synapses. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">The <strong>compound cluster</strong> is third and final type of object in Louis' neural network. These require a specific combination of neurotransmitters to be activated and cannot be split into nerve cells. When activated, they grand Louis an ability or projection which he can use in combat.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">Synapses are unlocked based on the sequences of neural activations within Louis' nerual network, for instance, if there are 5 red transmitters in a row, Louis gains the synapse &quot;Fury Fist.&quot; There is an in-game &quot;synapse hunter&quot; which aids the player in their hunt for useful synapses.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe" size="2"><font face="Dotum, DotumChe" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><img src="../../pictures/break2.jpg" width="100%" height="17" alt="Page Break" longdesc="../../pictures/break2.jpg" /></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe">The <strong>Dynamic Equip System</strong> (DES) reffers to the manner in which Louis’ equipment changes gradually throughout the game  based on the player’s play style (and Louis’ creativity). It also gets stronger  as he gets stronger. He begins with a dyn. One-hander and a partial suit. He eventually fills out  the suit, gets another one-hander, a two-hander, a shield, and a set of ranged  weapons (two one-handed, one two-handed).</font></p>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Dotum, DotumChe"><p>A simple example of equipment dynamics; If the player  deals large amounts of damage in combat, but has no sense of self preservation,  then the modeling algorithm begins to make Louis’ attire appear more jagged,  even serrated. The statistical algorithm then adjusts the bonuses so that the  armor gives more power and less threshold. </p>
<p>Static Loot is also obtained from enemies for two reasons: to equip to <strong>memories</strong> and <strong>dreams</strong> (party members) and to allow the player to change their play style abruptly (with high enough creativity, suits of equipment can be changed instantly in mid-combat) by giving them an opportunity to equip something that fits their current needs more effectively. </p></font>
