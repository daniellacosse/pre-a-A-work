There's a few things on the agenda today - first, I feel that I'm finally in a position where I can again promise two updates a month - two quality updates. I don't know if this is considered a quality update, because I'm not really changing anything on the site per se... but I am going to point you toward a couple things I've been involved with in the recent weeks.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Dotum, DotumChe">One - I shot and submitted a commercial to Poptent <a href="http://www.poptent.net/media/41894/1">here</a>. I don't feel as if we'll win, but it's not bad. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Dotum, DotumChe">Two - I compiled a graphic design/image portfolio <a href="http://danielacosse.daportfolio.com/">here</a>. It's a pretty comprehensive image portfolio, but unfortunately contains no video or music work of mine. </font></p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Dotum, DotumChe">OKAY. It's been a rough couple of months. I finally have the time and resources to put together a small update. It's been one year already... and not much to show for it. Amid computer crashes, health issues and other issues, I think things are finally starting to get better. Unfortunately I'm going back home for a month and won't have the resources there to update the site. At least, I'm pretty sure I won't, unless some people come through for me. Don't expect anything, although I don't think that anyone has grown to expect much out of this endeavor. I only have time to add one thing, mainly for integrity's sake. A new <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUSJofa-x9g">video</a>. I didn't link it in the video page because I'm planning on redoing that section. In fact, I plan on rehauling the whole site when I get back. Once I get Dreamweaver again, that is.</font></p></td>

      <p>Over the next couple of weeks I'll begin to start uploading content so that this framework is more than just an XHTML skeleton. Then people might actually think this site is interesting. </p>
      <p>I guess I'll just jump in and talk about my grand design. I hope that this project will evolve from just me talking about the ideas I have on a regular basis and attempting to realize them (the good ones, that is) to, at some point,  an actual userbase, allowing others to post their own concepts (with some sort of legal disclaimer, of course). For now it's kind of just a thing to take up the little spare time I have. </p>
