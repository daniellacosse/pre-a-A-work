  <font face="Dotum, DotumChe" size=3>The following is a series of short film projects I've completed over the last couple of years. The video right below this text is the most recent and the furthest video from this text is the oldest. If you are so compelled to view them chronologically, I suggest you scroll to the bottom of the page and work your way up. I will post new videos as they become available, and the ones that aren't on YouTube will be there soon.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Dotum, DotumChe" size="2">My first attempt at satire; one thing I've always found is that most serious trailers are hysterical to me. I think it's something about how they expect to entice you into their world under a minute by flashing random sequences of nonsense rather than presenting a concise and engaging scene from either the movie or from pure conception, meaning, an original sequence with the movie's characters to convey a sense of engagement  without devaluing the original work to the viewer. There's plenty of good stuff that gets left on the editing floor, why not just use that? This keeps the mystery intriguing, and doesn't spoil all of the funny parts. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Dotum, DotumChe" size="2">Anyway, I did this during a summer program known in North Carolina as &quot;Governor's School,&quot; mainly because I was on the film crew and wanted to take advantage of the resources that they had, which were far superior to those of the previous video. I used a DVD camcorder (I can't remember the exact model, but it was definitely SD) and iMovie. I also had access to a large body of students, as exemplified by the large mass of students in the video. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Dotum, DotumChe">Given the fact that I completed the project during a program which had required activities, I was obviously not completely free to work on this project with the entirety of my will. There was no opportunity for ADR, as can be demonstrated by the horrendous squeaking in the beginning. I fell my greatest achievement was the fact I was able to convince the Dean and Program Figurehead to participate. I also like the way the credits are done, except for the fact that they are practically unreadable.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Dotum, DotumChe">ERRATA: In the credits, Rashad is, in fact, Roderick Cox. As I alluded to earlier, there was little time in which I could correct any mistakes.</font></p></td>
